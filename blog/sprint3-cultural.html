      <h2 class="blog-post-title">Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-text"><em>“Our feelings are our most genuine paths to knowledge.”</em><br>- Audre Lorde</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">What is Emotional Intelligence -</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">There is a lot of information about what EQ (emotional intelligence) is! The best way I have seen it described is as the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathise with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">How is it different to IQ? -</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">IQ (intelligence quotient) is score taken from tests designed to assess an individual's intelligence. IQ measures are only really to determine academic abilities, whereas EQ is a measure of an individual's ability to identify, evaluate, control, and express emotions.</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">Why is it important? -</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">EQ is important because it helps people build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve career and personal goals. It can also assist with connecting with personal feelings, turning intentions into actions, and making informed decisions about what matters most to an individual.</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">Here are some key skills for increasing EQ -</p><br>
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Self Management</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-text">The ability to control impulsive feelings and behaviours. Managing emotions in healthy ways, taking initiative, following through on commitments, and adapting to changing circumstances.</p><br>
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Self Awareness</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-text">Recognising personal emotions and how they affect thoughts and behaviour. Knowing ones strengths and weaknesses, and having self-confidence.</p><br>
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Social Awareness</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-text">Empathy. Understanding the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, picking up on emotional cues, feeling comfortable socially, and recognising the power dynamics in a group setting.</p><br>
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Relationship Management</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-text">Develop and maintain good relationships, communicating clearly, inspiring and influencing others, working well in a team, and managing conflict.</p><br>
