      <h2 class="blog-post-title">Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-text"><em>“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”</em><br>- Albert Einstein</p><br>
      <h2 class="blog-post-title">Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-text">Neuroplasticity by definition is the ability of the brain to form and reorganise synaptic connections, especially in response to learning or experience or following injury. Simply put, the brain orders the body to adapt to suite its needs.</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">The benefits of neuroplasticity -</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">I understand Neuroplasticity as a tool to allow ones self to heal, grow, rebuild and ultimately build resilience for what life can throw at you. The principles of neuroplasticity include the following:</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text"><em>Use it or lose it, use it and improve it, specificity, repetition matters, intensity matters, time matters, salience matters, age matters, transference and interference.</em></p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">The benefits of engaging with these principals are that one can create better habits that positively contribute to your success, health and well-being.</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">Engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity personally -</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">A principle that really stands out to me is <em>Use It or Lose It</em>. My brain has been laying relatively dormant for a number of years, repeating the same familiar actions repeatedly in work and general life. I see taking up the challenge to study web development and re-engage my brain as a big step towards engaging the principle of <em>Use It or Lose It.</em></p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">Another principle that links to taking up a new challenge for personal benefit is <em>Use It and Improve It</em>. I know during this process of learning new things on this course, that slowly (but surely), my skills, mind and thought patterns can change and expand for the better. I’m hopeful for a more positive mental attitude to develop as I grow!</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">Ways to increase neuroplasticity -</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">This list might seem too straight forward, but there are some very simple ways to increase neuroplasticity. They include:</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text"><em>Get enough quality sleep and rest, exercise both the body and the mind, reduce stress, find motivation and set goals, find relaxation through reading and writing, that is unrelated to work.</em></p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-text">Growth Mindset by definition when people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This kind of framework can create a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. A growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">What it growth mindset and why it is relevant -</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">Engaging with a growth mindset (the belief that you are in control of your own ability, and can learn and improve) is the key to success. Yes, hard work, effort, and persistence are all important too, but not as important as having that underlying belief that you are in control of your own journey. The idea of stretching existing abilities really stands out to me, as its a really counter regular fixed mindset statement “you have it, or you don’t” and that you can only ever sort of work with what you have. Another point that stands out to me is Carol Dwecks idea of the <em>'Power of YET'</em>. It’s the promise of better things to come. As for the why its relevant, I would say that its counter culture to hope for the best and take steps towards a potentially better you, and better world.</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">Exploration notes -</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text"><em>"Do what you love, and don't stop until you get what you love. Work as hard as you can, imagine immensities."</em> -Debbie Millman</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">I came across this quote while researching and I found it really uplifting. It definitely echoes that everyone can change and grow through application and experience. Not just some people, but all people, which is very encouraging at this time.</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">Integrating a growth mindset into my learning journey -</p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">I think simply trying to stay positive and open to the possibilities is the best I can hope for. Trying not to cut myself off with negative self talk will go a long way!</p>
