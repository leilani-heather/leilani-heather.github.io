        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Minesweeper</h2>

        <p class="blog-post-text">
          I've tried to complete the classic game of minesweeper. The objective of the game is to clear a square grid containing hidden 
          "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them. Clearing safe squares will give you clues about the number of neighbouring mines. 
          To win the game all mines must be "flagged" and all the safe squares revealed. There are only two controls in minesweeper. 
          They are –– Left click: <em>reveal squares</em> and Right click: <em>flag squares</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-post-text">
          Currently my game is working (ish) but it triggers the win message I think potentially too soon so I think theres something I need to debug! 
          Just not sure what it is just yet. Play my funny little version of minesweeper <a href="https://leilani-heather.github.io/minesweeper/index.html">here.</a>

        <p class="blog-post-text">
          I've tried to complete this challenge alone but ended up relying heavily on the youtube tutorial posted in the Foundations slack for guidance. 
          Currently my game is working but I would like to carry out the stretch challenges to upgrade it at a later date.

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Whack-a-Mole</h2>

        <p class="blog-post-text">
          This challenge seemed the most straight forward to me and it repeated much of what featured in the previous challenges. 
          I watched the youtube tutorial posted in the Foundations slack for guidance but overall was able to follow the instructions set out in the challenge. 
          Currently my game is working but I would like to carry out the stretch challenges to upgrade it at a later date.
