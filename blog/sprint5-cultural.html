        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Final Reflections</h2>

        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">
          Some new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning -
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          Through the emotional intelligence block I realised that I could really benefit from increasing my EQ for resilience purposes. 
          Foundations has really pushed me much further than I ever thought would be possible, so having emotional intelligence in mind has 
          been a helpful framework to learn and grow from.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          Reflections on my <em>why</em> for studying at EDA have also been really eye opening on a personal level. I had a vision for my <em>why</em> before 
          I started this course but it wasn’t fully realised, it was all hypothetical. I’ve had some great moments to reflect and feedback to 
          myself much more than I realised was going to be possible. Feeling very thankful for the time and space to do process these kinds of ideas.
        </p>
    
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">
          The role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming -
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          Values inform our personal strengths and weaknesses and in general tell us <em>what makes us tick</em> They play an important role in helping us to 
          understand <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> we might respond to any challenges that come our way. New learning journeys are usually a constant 
          challenge, so it's really important to know what you’re working with on a personal and professional level before you get started. It makes it 
          easier to reflect and grow, and ultimately be kinder to yourself when you know your own limitations or boundaries.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          Empathy in the same way plays an important role. If you can’t understand and share the feelings of another, you’re likely going to find it difficult 
          to share your own feelings about the learning process and feel very isolated and alone in that reflection.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          Self awareness is partially mentioned in both of the above points. Recognising personal emotions and how they affect thoughts and behaviour is very 
          important when facing new challenges.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">
          Surprises and the core learning -
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          Something that has taken me by surprise is that I thought I knew myself very well, and that was a fixed idea in my mind. What I hadn’t considered, and something 
          that revealed it self to me in the core learning blocks is that there is always more to learn about ones self. I didn’t realise that I might not be as open as 
          I thought I was to learning more about myself in order to grow into a more positive person.
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">
          Challenging aspects of the core learning –
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          I think self reflection is difficult but very essential! If I’m honest, sitting with information about myself that perhaps I don’t really like was challenging for me.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">
          Why the focus on core learning in a web development bootcamp course -
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          Because we’re people and not computers! We have emotions, personal histories, values, dreams and so on. All of these things are just floating around in our minds at any 
          given point in time, and don’t disappear while we’re all trying to apply ourselves to learning about web development. At some stage, something has to give if your brain 
          is being overloaded. Core learning helps build resilience for that breaking point, and ultimately helps one help themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">
          Time spent on core learning vs programming -
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          Personally, I cannot learn technical information, or retain and apply it if my mind is already preoccupied with personal thoughts and stressors. 
          I really value the balance of core learning vs programming. At some points I felt like I should just be focusing on programming, but in those exact 
          moments, when I was putting a lot of pressure on myself, the space and time for self reflection was the exact right thing I needed to spend time on.
