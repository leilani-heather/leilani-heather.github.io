          What is your long term goal and or career pathway -
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          My long term personal goal is to be happy, healthy and a good person now and always. Professionally, I don’t feel completely directionless but I also 
          don’t <em>exactly</em> know where I’m heading at this stage given that I’m at week two of course. Some short term goals I have are to successfully 
          navigate this course so I can look towards making long term plans for a brighter future. In terms of a career path way, I’m interested in investing the 
          skills and knowledge I gain while at EDA back into my community, specifically Pasifika women.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">
          What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          I would like to get better at working within a team environment, and investing a bit of time and practice with sharing work and trusting others in a team 
          setting.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">
          A description of your own strengths and limitations -
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          I am an honest (somewhat shy) person who values authenticity, honesty, creativity, loyalty, kindness, respect and good humour about all else. My strengths 
          are that I’m hard working, trustworthy, reliable, consistent, efficient and organised. My limitations are generally what hold me back personally less so 
          than professionally. I am extremely self critical and find it difficult to accept the good or positive feedback even if I know deep down that what I’m 
          experiencing or have achieved is worth praise. I find it very difficult to trust people also so this can be difficult in team work scenarios.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">
          Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme -
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          I am committed to being open to this experience. That sounds vague but I genuinely think its such a massive undertaking and a very unique experience so 
          that in itself is a massive commitment. I want to challenge myself to take the good with the bad, and to open up to my cohort classmates so that I don’t 
          isolate and struggle unnecessarily if I have questions or issues technically.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          I am also committed to setting clear time boundaries for my work hours, maximising the time that I am working on EDA course work and taking a solid break 
          to rest and not burn out from overworking and a tendency to be a perfectionist. I think setting clear boundaries for this will help me to strike up a good 
          balance to avoid burn out. I have friends and family to reach out to, who are aware of the intensity of this course and who are supporting me through out 
          with daily check ins.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post-text">
          My expectation from the facilitation team is to be supported technically in an open and honest way that is helpful to my overall learning.
