      <h5 class="blog-post-category">Technical - Sprint 3</h5>
      <h2 class="blog-post-title">JavaScript vs. HTML and CSS</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-preview-text">Proceed with caution: This post is long!</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">The differences between HTML and CSS -</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">HTML is used to create the content of a page and CSS is responsible for the design and style. When they work together as a team they are a very powerful duo. When they try to work solo, they're still great but not as useful. Teamwork makes the dream work!</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">You could say that HTML is like a moving company delivering your household contents to you in boxes when moving to a new house. You've picked all of the items for your house, you've organised your assets into boxes and now you want to unpack, display and use them else where. CSS is a bit like being an interior designer for your new space –– you unpack your boxes, then decorate and layout your new house so that it is pleasing to look at and practical to use.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">Control flow and loops in everyday life -</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">Control flow refers to the order that instructions or statements are executed in. These instructions are created using control flow statements. JavaScript supports control flow statements which means that developers can use these sets of instructions to incorporate interactivity to a webpage.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, so we have a handy control flow statement called a <em>loop</em> which can change the control flow path and make it possible to reroute the order that our instructions are carried out in.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">Loops cause instructions to repeat until a certain condition is met. They offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">I think of control flow as being a plan, and a loop as the tool to help deal with variations to plan. For example, here is my daily routine for feeding my dog each morning.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">
                                    1. Wake up at 5am<br>
                                    2. Turn on the lights<br>
                                    3. Locate the dog food bowl<br>
                                    4. Locate the dog food container<br>
                                    5. Open the dog food container</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">                          
                                    [Here’s where a loop might take place]<br><br>
                                    <em>IF: there isn’t any dog food left, go buy more & refill the container<br>
                                    ELSE: Scoop one serving of dog food into a cup</em></p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">  
                                    6. Close the dog food container<br>
                                    7. Place one serving of dog food into the dog food bowl<br>
                                    8. Go back to sleep and let the dog eat in peace</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">The DOM -</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">A little recap of what we know so far...</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">HTML | The Foundation - A house, a framework.<br>Think: The walls of a house. It’s in charge of structure and content of a webpage.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">CSS | The Aesthetic - The interior design of a house, the style.<br>Think: Paint colour on wall. It’s used to control of the visual design and layout of a webpage.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">JavaScript | The Moving Parts - The interactive parts of a house.<br>Think: A light switch on the painted wall that turn the lights on). Used to control the behaviour of different elements of a webpage.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">DOM | All of the above, contained in one place.<br>Think: Walking through a fully completed, furnished, functioning house that is well organised. It’s a location where HTML, CSS and JavaScript are working together. It is used to represent the webpage in a structured way that it is easy for programmers to navigate through.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">DOM stands for ‘Document Object Model’ and as its name suggests, it is an object-oriented representation of an HTML document. It is not exactly a carbon copy of the HTML document it’s drawing down from. It is more like an attempt to convert the HTML document into an object version that can be used or modified using scripting or programming languages.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">The DOM can be thought of as tree or many trees, a forest even! Its structure can be described as a tree-like representation of a document a.k.a DOM tree. Think of a DOM tree as a single parent stem that branches out into several child branches, each which may have leaves. It represents documents as <em>nodes</em> and <em>objects</em>. <em>Nodes</em> are all the different components that a webpage is made up of. They are any type of object or element in the DOM tree. <em>Objects</em> and elements are one type of node.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">Because of this tree-like structure mentioned previously, scripting languages such as JavaScript can connect to a page and manipulate the DOM. With the DOM, we can easily access and change tags, IDs, classes, attributes or elements using commands or methods. Developers interact with the DOM by accessing it using Chrome DevTools.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects -</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">I’m still trying to understand the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects myself, so here is my very limited understanding of the two.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">Objects represent things with characteristics (properties). They are helpful when you want to organise your information based on data labels. They consist of a key / value pair. Properties in objects can be altered by using either dot . or bracket [ ] notation.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">Arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable. They are helpful when order is the most important factor for organising your information. Arrays use zero-based indexing, which means they start counting at 0 rather than 1. When you want to get information from an array, you use the index number of each element.</p>
                    <p class="blog-post-text strong-text">Functions -</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">Functions are one of the main building blocks of JavaScript. They are a set of statements that are designed perform tasks once they’re ‘called’. Literally in the same way that I might call for my dog and give him an instruction, <em>“Bootsy, come and eat your breakfast!”</em>, you can call them by their name and they'll get to work on the specific task you have asked of them.</p>
          <p class="blog-post-text">Functions are an extremely useful time saver because they can repeat tasks for you, and they can be used and reused without limits. This means if you have a lot of code that needs repeating you can call a function for help so you don’t have to repeatedly write the same piece of code over and over. Maybe a little like phoning a friend, if that friend also happens to be a genius who wants to help make your life easier!</p>
          <br><br><h2 class="blog-post-title">Pro Tip</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-text">I find it helpful to think about what the DOM is <em>not</em>. Sounds silly but it’s important to remember that the DOM is not a programming or scripting language –– It’s an interface! So without it, a scripting language like JavaScript doesn’t have a clue about webpages, HTML & CSS documents and their elements.</p>
